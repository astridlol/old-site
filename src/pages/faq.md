### What are your favorite libraries?

Currently, I'm in love with [Prisma](https://prisma.io) and [tRPC](https://trpc.io/). Both of them make full stack web development incredibly easy.

<br />

### How did you learn to code?

Lots and lots of days of trial and error, along with being homeschooled, that might of helped a bit.

<br />

### Do you do commissions?

Yes! Reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maybeastrid) for more info ðŸ’œ

<br />

### What is your favourite web framework?

I haven't really played around with many, but my go-to is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

<br />

### What programming languages do you know?

I'm well versed in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), and pretty decent in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I've played around with [Python](https://python.org) & [Go](https://go.dev/), though I wouldn't consider myself proficent in them.

<br />

### What have you been working on?

Not much if I'm being honest. There's some small projects like [Keycard](https://github.com/astridlol/Keycard), but most project I create don't require much updates.

<br />

### Do you have a Discord server?

I do, [here](https://discord.gg/u8gqAsC96e). Though it's not too active, mostly just there to announce small things.

<br />

### Favorite color?

Definitly pink, if you couldn't tell. It's a main color of this site :)

<br />

### Will you do a face reveal?

No. I dislike my face for several reasons, so no one can see it unless they're **super** close to me.

<br />

### Will you do a voice reveal?

I don't plan to ever, not publicly at least. Same reasons as to why I won't face reveal, except I can tolerate my voice better.
