Here's a little list to clarify things. <br/>
Last updated: May 10th, 2023.

<br />

- Stop jumping to conclusions. While this can go for A LOT of things, I'm mostly refering to the speed of my DMs.
  I reply when I'm free, and when I feel like it. <br /> I **do not** owe _anyone_ a response. I **_am not_** ignoring you because I hate you.
  - If you've really thought I missed the DM, feel free to send a new one after a few hours, _not a few minutes..._
- Quit asking about my <BlurredText>genitalia-</BlurredText> like, that's just weird. why do you care?
- Don't be sexual towards me. A small bit of jokes are fine, but when you make it your whole personality- ðŸ¤®
- Tying in with the last point. Please **_do not_** mention overly sexual stuff to me.
  I do not want to hear about you <BlurredText>jacking off,</BlurredText> or the details of your <BlurredText>sex life.</BlurredText>
  That stuff should be kept with your S/O _if you even have one_
- Do not ask me to voice / face reveal to you. I hate them both for various reasons and it's something I'm insecure about.
  It is a gift given :)
- Don't "jokingly" use the wrong pronouns for me. It can actually confuse people, and that's nottt really something I want. My pronouns are **she/her**.
- You cannot "rizz" me. stop trying; it's cringe. I'm not looking for a relationship, especially not one on Discord.
