This project was made with user friction in mind. I wanted it to be as **minimal** as possible. This means no logging into OAuth, or dealing with annoying captchas (I'm looking at you, recaptcha..)

<br />

### Backend tech

<br />

- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), for an amazing backend.
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/), for the ORM.
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/), for the database.

### Frontend tech

<br />

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), obviously.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), not used much, but provides good styles.
- [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/), for bringing user friction to its lowest point.

<br />

Now that we got some tech covered, let's get into some more details. Keycard doubles as a full-stack application, with the API, Discord bot, and frontend all in one. This is possible using HTTP interactions, which make the infrastructure all in one place, and without a hassle.

<br />
<br />

When a user verifies themselves successfully, their Discord ID and hashed IP address are stored into a table, _(see schema [here](https://github.com/astridlol/Keycard/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L34))_. This is saved for the alt detection, which scans this table for the same hashed IP address. If there's a match, then a log is sent to the configured Discord channel.
