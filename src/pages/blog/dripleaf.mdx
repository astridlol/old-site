For those who aren't aware, Dripleaf is a Minecraft server hosting network I have been developing since the start of the year.

<br />
## But what does that mean?

To put it simply, a Minecraft server hosting network is where users can create a Minecraft server and will be able to connect to it through our lobby; thus creating a "network" of Minecraft servers.

<br />
## How is this possible?

Dripleaf is made possible by **so many** amazing technologies. Let's start with the proxy side of things, then we can get into the fun stuff later.

<br />
### Proxy technology

The "proxy" is the Minecraft server players connect to. It connects them to the entire network of Dripleaf, giving them access to play any currently running server.<br/><br/>

- The proxy software of choice was [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) due to its ease of use, regular updates, and security.
- For the proxy to connect with the backend, and vice versa, [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) is used as our WebSocket client.
  Pusher was chosen due to how "complex" solutions like socket.io can be, as well as its support for serverless architecture

<br />
### App technology

The entire frontend and backend of Dripleaf are bootstrapped with [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/), which makes it easy for you to create an app with bootstrapped technologies. The stack of Dripleaf is meant to increase speed, and it surely succeeded at that.<br/><br/>

- For our database, we're using [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) with [Prisma 5](https://prisma.io/) as our ORM. This has been such an enjoyable experience, and I can't imagine switching from Prisma.
- In terms of authentication, we use [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) for that. Some people hate it, some people love it. We chose it here due to the simplicity, and relieves the burden of maintaining and rolling our own auth.
- For error logging and analytics, we use self-hosted instances of both [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and [Plausible](https://plausible.io), both have been amazing so far.
- For our UI, we use various libraries to make it look good and function properly.
  - We've built on top of [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for the majority of our component library, so we can have our look without sacrificing functionality.
  - File uploads are handled by [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/), which makes things **very** simple in a short period of time.
  - For managing the several forms across the site, that's where [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) comes in. It provides easy-to-use validation and handling for any sort of form we need.
- Now, for our backend.
  - The majority of our backend is written using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), which creates a wonderful experience for both myself and the users. For routes that need to be easily accessed externally (e.g. in our Minecraft proxy), regular Next.js API routes are used.
  - For payments, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is used. Its developer experience has been top-tier as of right now.
  - For our emails, we use [Resend](https://resend.com/) along with [React Email](https://react.email/) to make them look awesome.
