As of April 10th, 2023, I've officially opened commissions! For right now, the things you can commission are the following:

<br />

- Minecraft plugins
- Discord bots

If you're interested in commissioning me, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maybeastrid), and we'll go from there. Please make sure to state the details concisely, so I can fulfill your needs properly :)

<br />

## Pricing

Pricing is majorly based on the complexity of the project. Below you can find rough information on pricing for both plugins and Discord bots.

<br />

> These are the starting prices, the **finalized** price will be discussed within DMs.

<br />

### Minecraft plugins

Minecraft plugins start at **$5**, and are built with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) on top of the Spigot API. Pricing will scale depending on the complexity, and amount of features.

<br />

### Discord bots

<br />
This section uses some terminology you need to know, the explanations are below.
<br />
> ### Interactions: <br />
> Interactions include anything from buttons, to slash commands <br />
> ### Gateway events: <br />
> Gateway events are events that aren't interactions. Examples include message
deletion, > member join, and more. <br />

<br />

<br />

A simple Discord bot that doesn't listen to gateway events, and only uses interactions, starts at **$2.50**. This is due to not needing 24/7 hosting :)

<br />

Meanwhile, bots that rely on gateway events will start at **$5**, due to needing to be online 24/7 to function. Bots with these needs will be made using [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) and the [DiscordX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discordx) library.

<br />

### Terms of Service

<br />
> The first two points are waived for those with an [Exclusive](#exclusive-licenses)
license.
<br />

- You cannot leak your resource anywhere.
  - Your commission was made for you, and you only.
- You cannot resell any resource you acquired from me.
  - This goes hand in hand with the first point, though profiting off of **my work** is really scummy.
- You cannot refund any of the resources you acquired from me.
  - Small changes can be made upon request.
  - If the resource is not what you're looking for, let me know! Maybe we can come to a compromise.

### Exclusive licenses

Exclusive licenses state that you are in complete control of your commission. With an exclusive license you can resell the resource, as well as modify it in its entirety, with access to the full source code. If you're interested in this, let me know when commissioning.
